# Our Comment Policy: Be a Good Human
Welcome to the community! This is a space for open, respectful, and helpful conversations about real estate, homes, and everything in between. We love hearing your thoughts, questions, and stories, but here’s the deal:  

- Be Kind and Respectful: Let’s lift each other up, not tear each other down. Disagreements are fine, but kindness is non-negotiable.
- Stay on Topic: Let’s keep the conversation relevant to the blog or post. Random spam or unrelated rants will be removed faster than you can say “home sweet home.”
- No Hate or Harmful Content: Comments that include hate speech, discrimination, threats, or anything that hurts others don’t belong here—and they’ll be removed.
- Let’s Build, Not Break: This space is about creating a community. Negative vibes don’t just ruin the comment section—they chip away at the kind of world we’re all trying to build.
- If a comment isn’t in line with these guidelines, we reserve the right to remove it—because creating a positive, respectful space benefits everyone.

Let’s keep things kind, constructive, and helpful for the good of us all.  
<br> Thanks for being here!
